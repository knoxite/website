### Amazon S3

In order to use knoxite with AWS S3, you need to set up an IAM-Identity first,
as you cannot use S3 as a root-user. It is also recommended to create a separate
IAM-Identity for each application. Find more about creating IAM-Identities
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) or below.

#### URL Scheme

You can create a repository using knoxite's `s3` or `s3s` (for usage with SSL) protocols:

```bash
knoxite repo init s3s://[username]:[password]@s3.amazonaws.com/[region]/[bucketprefix]
```

However, it is not considered safe to use username and password here. Instead, 
it is recommended to use access keys. The access key id as well as the secret 
access key can then be used by knoxite using the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and 
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables. You can find more information about
creating access keys for your IAM-Identity below.


A repository will be stored as 3 different buckets on S3. Those buckets will be generated automatically.
The names of the buckets are:

- `[bucketprefix]-chunks`
- `[bucketprefix]-snapshots`
- `[bucketprefix]-repository`

All s3 bucket names are unique globally. Therefore, please consider choosing a reasonable
bucketprefix. You can find more information on restrictions and naming requirements of s3 buckets
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-s3-bucket-naming-requirements.html).


#### Create an IAM-Identity with an Access Key

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the official AWS documentation.

While it is not required to set up a separate IAM-Identity for knoxite itself, it 
is recommended to do so. However, you can also just create an Access Key 
for your Administrator (or really any other IAM-User with the right permissions).

After logging into the AWS Management Console, go to the IAM-Dashboard:

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/s3/s3_step1.png" title="open IAM Dashboard">}}

On the IAM-Dashboard, go to Users and add a new user:

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/s3/s3_step2.png" title="Add new User on IAM Dashboard">}}

Select a username for your knoxite-User. As "Access Type", choose "Programmatic access". Press next.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/s3/s3_step3.png" title="Choose username and Access Type">}}

As we only want to use this user to interact with our s3 buckets, select 
"Attach existing policies directly", search for s3 and select "AmazonS3FullAccess". Press next.
If you do not want to set any tags, you can just continue and press next again.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/s3/s3_step4.png" title="Set Permissions">}}

Review the new user and press "Create user".

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/s3/s3_step5.png" title="Review new user">}}

Now, you can copy the "Access key ID" as well as the "Secret access key" and use
them with knoxite.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/s3/s3_step6.png" title="Review new user">}}

### Azure File Storage

In order to store data on Azure you need to set up an Azure File Storage for
your knoxite repository first.

#### URL Scheme

You can create a repository using knoxite's `azurefile` protocol:

```bash
knoxite repo init -r azurefile://[storage_account_name]:[access_key]@[endpoint]
```

On Azure you can find the storage account name and the access key at
**Storage Account** > **Access keys**.

{{< note-urlencoded what="the **access token**" >}}

##### Endpoint
The endpoint is the URL of the folder you want your repository stored in.
The storage account name as a prefix of the URL is optional, so you can use
either one of the following formats:

`[account].file.core.windows.net/[share]/[path]` or
`file.core.windows.net/[share]/[path]`

##### Example

```
azurefile://account:Dbx...%2Fz7U...%2FQLX...B6w%3D%3D@file.core.windows.net/share/path
```

#### Setting up your Azure File Storage
In order to use Azure File Storage you need to add a resource of the type
**Storage account - blob, file, table, queue**. Then you can use the
**Storage Explorer** to create a new **File Share**.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/azure/azure_create_file_storage_focus.png" title="create file storage">}}

After that you can set **Name** and **Quota**. Always keep an eye on your qouta
because knoxite may fail to store files when the maximum is reached.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/azure/azure_create_file_storage_2_focus.png" title="set filestore name and quota">}}

The next step is to create the root folder for your knoxite repository.
Use the **New Folder** button to add a new folder in the created file share. You
can use the **Copy URL** button to get the endpoint needed for the azurefile
repository-URL.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/azure/azure_create_folder_copy_url_focus.png" title="create folder and copy url">}}

The last missing parameters to complete the URL are the **Storage account name**
and one of the **Access keys**, which you can simply copy from
**Settings** > **Access keys**.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/azure/azure_access_keys_focus.png" title="get credentials">}}

### Backblaze

In order to to use your B2 Cloud Storage you'll have to setup an application key
first. Then you can use the application's credentials in knoxite's
repository-URL.

#### URL Scheme

You can use the `backblaze` protocol to initialize a B2 Cloud Storage
repository:

```bash
knoxite repo init -r backblaze://[keyID]:[applicationKey]@/[path]
```

#### Create a new Application

To gather the **keyID** and **applicationKey** you'll have to login to your
account on [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) and go to the **App Keys**
section. There you can click on the **Add a New Application Key** Button.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/backblaze/backblaze_add_application_key_focus.png" title="add application key">}}

After that you'll just need to fill in a name for your new application.
Optionally you can limit access to certain buckets.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/backblaze/backblaze_create_new_key_focus.png" title="create new key">}}

The generated **applicationKey** and **keyID** can now be used as part of the
repository-URL.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/backblaze/backblaze_key_created_focus.png" title="created key">}}

Note that the application key will only be displayed once. Make sure to store it
in a secure place.

### Dropbox

This is the storage backend for the [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) cloud
storage.

##### Usage

You'll need to provide an OAuth2 access-token in the repository-URL in order for
the Dropbox storage backend to work:

```bash
knoxite repo init -r dropbox://[access_token]@/[path]
```

##### Retrieving an access-token

Assuming you already have an account on Dropbox you'll have to create an app on
Dropbox's developer platform. This can be done [here](https://dropbox.com/developers/apps/).
You can either grant knoxite full access to all folders on your Dropbox or limit
its permissions to a single folder. Note that the name for your Dropbox app has
to be unique.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/dropbox/dropbox_create_new_app_focus.png" title="create app">}}

After creating the app Dropbox will redirect you to its info page. Here you will
have to generate the OAuth2 access-token for knoxite. This can be done with a
single click on the corresponding button:

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/dropbox/dropbox_generate_access_token_focus.png" title="generate token">}}

This access-token can now be used in knoxite's repository-URL. It is recommended
to save the token in a secure place as Dropbox will only show it to you once.
You can however always generate a new token.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/dropbox/dropbox_generated_access_token_focus.png" title="generated token">}}

### Google Cloud Storage

This backend enables knoxite to store data in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
If you are not familiar with Google Cloud Console, see the detailed guide below
in the **Setting up Google Cloud Storage** section.

#### URL Scheme

You can create a repository using the `googlecloudstorage` protocol:

```bash
knoxite repo init -r googlecloudstorage://[path_to_key.json]@/[bucket]/[path]/
```

{{< note-urlencoded what="the **path to the key**" >}}

##### JSON key

As mentioned above, Google Cloud expects credentials in the form of a JSON key.
The path to the JSON file, probably stored on your local filesystem, needs to be
provided either via the URL or the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
variable.

Unlike the parameter in the URL, the path in the environment variable does
**not** need to be URL-encoded.

When using the environment variable the path to the JSON file can be omitted, as
shown in the second example below.

##### Examples

```bash
knoxite repo init -r googlecloudstorage://%2Ftmp%2Fknoxite-733f1cccf67c.json@/knoxite/backups/
knoxite repo init -r googlecloudstorage:///knoxite/backups/
```

#### Setting up Google Cloud Storage

There are multiple steps necessary to set up your environment on Google Cloud
Console.

##### Creating a project

Create a project on Google Cloud Storage, should you not have done so previously.
This project will be the container for the Google Cloud Storage you want to use.

##### Creating a bucket

In order to create a bucket you need to navigate to **Storage** > **Browser**.
The preferences chosen here are merely an example, but might be sensible for
backups that you only access occasionally.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/googlecloud/focus/gcloud_create_bucket1_focus.png" title="create bucket part 1">}}
{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/googlecloud/focus/gcloud_create_bucket2_focus.png" title="create bucket part 2">}}

##### Creating a folder for your repository

After creating a bucket you need to add a new folder, which will be used to
store the repository in:

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/googlecloud/focus/gcloud_create_folder_focus.png" title="create folder in bucket">}}

##### Adding a service account

In order to access the bucket through knoxite you need a service account.

Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts** and create a new service
account:

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/googlecloud/focus/gcloud_serviceaccount_create_focus.png" title="create service account">}}

##### Granting access

For the service account to be permitted to access the bucket, you need to grant
it access to the project. For testing purposes we choose the Storage Admin role
here. For production use we recommend to set specific roles that fit your needs:

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/googlecloud/focus/gcloud_serviceaccount_grantaccess_focus.png" title="create service account grant access">}}

##### Creating and downloading the key

As the last step of creating a service account you need to create a key, which
will be used to authenticate knoxite to access your cloud storage:

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/googlecloud/focus/gcloud_serviceaccount_finish_createkey_focus.png" title="create service account create key">}}

You can only download this key once, so we recommend you store it in a secure
place. Of course you are always able to create an entirely new key.

With the key downloaded you are now ready to use the Google Cloud Storage
backend.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/googlecloud/focus/gcloud_serviceaccount_createkey_focus.png" title="create service account download key">}}

---

### Mega

To store data on mega you need a mega account and its e-mail address and
password.

#### URL Scheme

You can use the `mega` protocol in order to interact with this backend.

{{< note-urlencoded what="the **e-mail address**" >}}

```bash
knoxite repo init -r mega://[email]:[password]@/[path]
```

##### Example

```bash
knoxite repo init -r mega://user%40example.com:password@/knoxite
```

---

### Nextcloud

You can connect knoxite to a Nextcloud instance using the WebDAV backend.

It is recommended to use an app password. To generate one, go to the settings
page of your Nextcloud instance. Navigate to the **Security** section. In
**Devices & sessions** you can generate a new app password.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/owncloud_nextcloud/nextcloud_apppassword_step1.png">}}

Save the application password in a secure location, as it can only be shown once.

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/owncloud_nextcloud/nextcloud_apppassword_step2.png">}}

If you want to save your knoxite repository in a directory, now is the time to
create that folder.

Next, you have to get the WebDAV-URL of your Nextcloud instance and modify the
URL a bit. Go to your file overview and click on the settings button in the
bottom left. A menu containing the WebDAV-URL should appear:

{{<lbimg src="/images/backends/owncloud_nextcloud/nextcloud_webdav_path.png">}}

Copy the WebDAV-URL and modify it by the following rules:

- replace the `http` / `https` protocol with `webdav` / `webdavs`
- add your username and password to the URL

The URL can now be used to initialize a new repository:

```bash
knoxite repo init -r webdavs://[user]:[password]@example.com/remote.php/webdav/[path]
```

---

### ownCloud

See [Nextcloud](#nextcloud).

---

### SSH/SFTP

In order to store data on another computer with SSH, you can use the SFTP
backend. You have to authenticate via password or a private key using an
`ssh-agent`. Make sure to check if `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is set. Verify that
`~/.ssh/known_hosts` contains a valid host key.

```bash
knoxite repo init -r sftp://[user]:[password]@example.com/[path]
```

---

### WebDAV

Although the WebDAV-backend should be compatible with every WebDAV server, right
now it is only tested with Nextcloud and ownCloud.

You have to replace the `http` / `https` protocol in the URL with `webdav` /
`webdavs`. Authentication works via basic/digest auth. You have to create the
target folder for the repository on WebDAV.

```bash
knoxite repo init -r webdavs://[user]:[password]@example.com/[path]
```
