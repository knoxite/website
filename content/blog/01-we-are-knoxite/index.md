# Hi - we are Team Knoxite!

But who is "we"? And what is `knoxite`? And what is this blog all about?

Let me explain all this to you!

## So, what is `knoxite`?

[knoxite](https://github.com/knoxite/knoxite) describes itself as

> "[...] a secure data storage & backup system.".

Written in the statically-typed programming language [Go](https://golang.org/) by the software developer muesli, `knoxite` is developed as a open source project on github.

Another nice way to describe it is the term 

> RAID for the cloud

as redundancy is one of the mail features of knoxite. If you want to know more about knoxite, be sure to check out the github repository!

## But who is Team Knoxite? And why does it exist?

Team Knoxite are [penguwin](https://github.com/penguwin), [mahartma](https://github.com/ma-hartma) and I, [craftamap](https://github.com/craftamap)! 

We are currently in fourth semester of university studying computer science, and this semester
we are taking part at a project called "Digital Innovation@project".
The main goal of the project is to show how you can make it from a digital, cool (and innovative)
idea to a business by learning how to "sell" your idea to a investor while implementing your MVP.

But you might be confused, on how the terms "open source" and "business" can fit together.
And that's were we are bringing fresh air into the project "Digital Innovation@project".
While developing more features for our lovely knoxite, we are also trying 
to lay the foundation for a "knoxite" foundation,
a company supporting the knoxite project as well as related projects.

On the development side of things, we are trying to get knoxite to a level of development,
were we can publish a version `1.0`. This includes some basic ideas like more storage backend, 
up to awesome ideas we will talk about in the future!

## So, what is this blog all about?

This blog has two main purposes: To let us track, what we did in which week,
as well as let YOU know, what we achieved in which week. The (hopefully weekly) blogposts
do not only contain informationabout (sometimes boring, sometimes interesting) pull requests, 
but also tell the story of us finding out on how to be founders of a foundation.

## So, what was accomplished so far? And what are the plans for the next weeks?

So far, the project is running for 3 weeks. However, since the first weeks consisted mainly of 
organizational work, there not much to show so far. However, we created a so called `lean canvas`
to bundle the main idea of the business we want to found and (honestly for us more important) the
software we want to develop and improve!

With this week, we want to start to work on more features for knoxite. Read next week on what we archieved!
