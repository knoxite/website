visit this website for An open-source data storage & backup system.

Features :
1. Connectivity : You can use multiple storage backends, even parallely: local disks, Dropbox, Amazon S3 & others
2. Efficiency : knoxite cleverly de-duplicates your data before storing it and supports multiple compression algorithms
3. Flexibility : You can always extend your storage size or move your stored data to another machine
4. Open-Source : knoxite is free software. Contribute and spread the word!
5. Security : knoxite uses AES-encryption to safely store your data


Store your data wherever you want:
Not only can you connect Knoxite to a wide range of Cloud services, you can even combine them all and make the most of your available space.
You've chosen a cloud provider for your data before? We may already support it!
Select between various protocols and standards like SSH, WebDAV or FTP or cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Amazon S3, BackBlaze, NextCloud, DropBox and many others!


Like RAID-storage, but for the Cloud:
knoxite uses checksums and parity-data to protect your bits & bytes. You can even tweak its fault-tolerance level to your needs. A malicious hacker or unreliable storage backend should never jeopardize your data.
