# The knoxite website

:gift: This repository contains the knoxite [website](https://knoxite.com).

## Prerequisities üë©‚Äçüíª

Make sure you have all of the following prerequisites installed on your
development machine:

* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux
  machines typically have this already installed.
* Hugo - [Download & Install
  Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). The Hugo framework can
  typically be installed by the package manager of your choice.

## Getting started :runner:

To run the website locally use following commands:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/knoxite/website.git
cd website
hugo serve -D
```

After running these commands the server will wait for incoming connections at
your **localhost**. As soon as you edit the content of the blogs configs or
markdown posts the server will live-reload the changes.
